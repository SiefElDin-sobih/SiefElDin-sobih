### Who am I?
- A neuroinformatics enthusiast, graduated from biotechnology program and sailing onwwards wherever bioinformatics and neuroscience meet. Currently persuing a master scholarship abroad in the previously mentioned fields, let's hope I get accepted.
### Life end goals?
- Hoping one day that I could work on human memory and cognition, and maybe one day we can transfer and store human memories in a retainable shape.
- Teach generations of students as a good and well-educated professor.
- Find novel mechanisms for Alzheimer Disease by studying it with Omics.
### What am I doing here?
- I am here because I want to encourage myself to code more and work on further projects in the field of computational neuroscience and bioinformatics. Possibly show others what I am working on which might offer collaboration opportunities.
### Ongoing projects?
- I will start adding them after November.
### Completed projects?
- I will start adding them after November.
